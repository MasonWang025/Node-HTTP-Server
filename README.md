# Node-HTTP-Server

An HTTP server built from scratch with Node (no express).

## Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MasonWang025/Node-HTTP-Server.git
npm install
npm start
```

<i>To run the development version (with nodemon):</i> `npm run dev`

## Serving HTML

The code in `serveHTMLPage.js` handles the HTTP request by either serving the requested HTML file or a 404 message. `index.js` handles the routes.
